Major Challenges that we faced during the developement of this project:
1. Git Push & branch conflicts: This bug ate up couple of hours of us. It was happening due to the presence of mulitple .git files inside the parent & working directory,
2. Routing in next.js and installing dependencies,
3.  Testing of the APIs with the Frontend code,
4. Deployment of Database to the cloud database,
5. Enabling multiple users chatting functionality,
6. Adding Chart.js library into Next.js.
